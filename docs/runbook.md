How to run pixel-phone. Sections are filled in as the pieces land.

## Deploying

## Secrets

Secrets live in each environment's Key Vault (`pixel-phone-dev-kv`, `pixel-phone-prod-kv`). [`infra/secrets.manifest.yaml`](../infra/secrets.manifest.yaml) is the list. Only `just secrets-push` writes them; Terraform only references them, so no value ever reaches Terraform state.

| Key Vault name | Environment variable | Feature | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `telnyx-api-key` | `TELNYX_API_KEY` | `telnyx` | Telnyx API key for Call Control commands |
| `telnyx-public-key` | `TELNYX_PUBLIC_KEY` | `telnyx` | The Telnyx account's Ed25519 public key (Mission Control → Keys & Credentials → Public Key) |
| `home-assistant-token` | `HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN` | `home-assistant` | Long-lived token of a non-admin Home Assistant user |
| `api-keys-yaml` | `API_KEYS_YAML` | `accept-api` | The accept API's callers, a YAML list of `id` and `key` |
| `sentry-dsn` | `SENTRY_DSN` | `sentry` | The Sentry project's DSN |

To set or change one:

1. Put the value in `.env.dev` (or `.env.prod`), with `PIXEL_PHONE_ENV=dev` (or `prod`) in the same file.
2. `just secrets-push dev`: shows which secrets change (never the values) and asks first. It never deletes.
3. If the secret's feature is off, turn it on in `infra/envs/dev/terraform.example.tfvars` and `just tf-apply dev`. Turning a feature on before its secrets exist stops new revisions from starting.
4. Otherwise `just restart dev`: the Container App reads secrets when a revision starts.

`just secrets-pull dev` goes the other way, after showing what changes. `just validate-secrets` checks the manifest.
